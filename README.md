# European-Soccer-Data
Data wrangling and exploratory analysis of European Soccer Data from Kaggle

## Introduction
This dataset was fetched from kaggle and consisted of data of the first (1st) tier of eleven (11) league competitions from season 2008/2009 to season 2005/2016, across Europe. It also comprised meta-data of teams, players and match information of the various leagues. There are seven (7) tables in this dataset; Country, League, Team, Team Attributes, Player, Player Attributes and Match

Before, we set of to clean our data, we asked the following questions which guided us in our exploratory analysis;
Which team and league had the most goals scored in that period (2008/2009-2015/2016)
Who was the best performing player across the eleven (11) leagues in that period (2008/2009-2015/2016)? or let's say the Balon D'or winner.

## Data Wrangling
The data was pulled from kaggle and each table came with a complete csv file and was programmatically assessed. The data was then cleaned for further analysis. Some of the issues were; 1. null values, which were dropped and not used for analyis 2. Changing of datatypes and 3. Merging of tables with a common variable for tidiness 4. Dropping of columns not needed in our analysis

## Exploratory Analysis
We performed our analysis to answer our questions on the cleaned data
